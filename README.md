## Lilypond Sources for Bach Cello Suites

This repo will eventually contain [lilypond][] sources for all the
suites for cello solo by Bach, Edited by me based on the
[Baerenreiter][baren] various sources.

Every suite should contain a `Makefile` with a `default` target and a
`preview` target (for generating PDFs with links). Later we'll add
*midi* output.
